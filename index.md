# Hello, world!

This is the CS50 AP platform which we will be using periodically throughout our class.
CS50 for the AP Classroom is based on CS50, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school, which satisfies the College Board's new AP CS Principles curriculum framework.
